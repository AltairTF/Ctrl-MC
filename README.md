## Project Description

This project is in early stages, the idea is to:

* Create an Arduino based motorcycle electronic unit for controlling electrical components for a 'classic' (=older) motorcycle
  * The project do not aim to replace or modify the motorcycle engine ignition system
  * This system will typically "start" after the generator/alternator and rectifier/regulator on the motorcyle has done it's job
* Provide software and instructions free of charge
* Create a community for motorcycle- and Arduino enthusiasts that want to contribute
* Make the solution universal and configurable, it should be suitable for as many motorcycle brands and models as possible

Long term goals, depending on the success of the project:
* Provide a DIY kit with all parts needed
* Provide a completely built solution ready to be installed on the bike

Some of the benefits the system (hopefully) will give:

* Reliability: Individial relays controls positive or negative lead per component
* Simplify wiring: Only one wire to handlebar switches for controlling multiple features, separate outputs per motorcycle component
* Providing customization: Custom handlebar buttons layout, setting parameters in code to adjust features
* Adding new features to the motorcycle (optional): 
  * Touch buttons instead of traditional handlebar switches
  * Keyless ignition using bluetooth/RF-ID, "password" pressing button switch combination
  * OLED display instead of traditional warning lights
  * Smart functions, ex: auto turn off indicator lights, not possible to trigger start motor when engine is running
* Use standard open source components based on Arduino board and Arduino add-on boards
* Provide a budget friendly solution as an alternative to  expensive commercial products
