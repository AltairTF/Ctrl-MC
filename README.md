## Project Description

This is a project in early stages, the idea is to:

* Create a motorcycle electronic unit for controlling all electrical components on a classic motorcycle
* Possibility to add new features to the motorcycle, ex: 
  * Touch buttons instead of traditional handlebar switches
  * Keyless ignition
  * OLED display instead of traditional warning lights
  * Smart functions, ex: auto turn off indicator lights, not possible to trigger start motor when engine is running
* Use standard Arduino board and Arduino supported add-on hardware
* Provide a budget friendly solution as an alternative to  expensive commercial products
